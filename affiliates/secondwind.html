<h2>Second Wind Dreams</h2>
<p>Fulfilling the dreams of those living in eldercare communities thereby enhancing their quality of life and improving the perception of aging.Second Wind Dreams, a national non-profit organization, has the goal of bringing seniors to the fore-front of our society to make them feel what they are— special. The program began with the work and passion of P. K. Beville, Ph.D., who co-wrote Second Wind, a heart warming look at the wonderful stories and people within nursing homes. Over the last five years, we have become involved in over 400 facilities in 38 states, Canada and India, changing society’s perception of aging one dream at a time.</p>
